=== TYPOGRAPHY (CRITICAL - MUST BE EXACT) ===

TOP TEXT BLOCK - horizontally centered, positioned at exactly 12% from top edge:

Line 1: "{{ category }}" in BOLD UPPERCASE - STYLIZED TITLE
- Font: Heavy condensed sans-serif (like Bebas Neue or Impact)
- Size: 144pt equivalent, MASSIVE and dominant (bigger than everything else)
- Color: Vertical gradient from bright white (#FFFFFF) at top to light silver/gray (#C0C0C0) at bottom
- Subtle 3D effect: thin black outline/stroke (2px) + soft drop shadow (not too heavy)
- Metallic sheen effect for premium look
- Letter-spacing: wide tracking for cinematic impact
- Style like a Hollywood blockbuster movie title card

Line 2: "{{ collection_display_name }}" directly below, small gap (8px equivalent)
- Font: Same font family, medium weight
- Size: 72pt equivalent (60% of category size) - MUST BE CLEARLY READABLE
- Color: White with subtle orange/gold outer glow effect
- Black drop shadow for contrast
- Add a small thematic emoji icon before the text

BOTTOM LOGO - horizontally centered, positioned at exactly 92% from top (8% from bottom):
- Text "{{ logo_text }}" only - NO background box
- Font: Bold condensed sans-serif, 48pt equivalent
- Color: Bright red (#E50914) like Netflix red
- Strong black drop shadow and black outline for readability
- Styled like the Netflix wordmark but with "{{ logo_text }}"

=== PHOTOREALISTIC RENDERING ===

- Shallow depth of field with cinematic bokeh
- {{ lighting_style }}
- Real textures: skin pores, fabric weave, surface imperfections
- Subtle film grain for cinematic feel
- Natural color grading, no oversaturation

=== STRICT LAYOUT INVARIANTS ===
- Text positioning MUST be identical across all generated images
- Category text at 12% from top, collection name immediately below with 8px gap
- {{ logo_text }} logo at 92% from top (8% from bottom)
- All text horizontally centered on the poster
- Subtle dark vignette/gradient at top and bottom for text readability
- Single coherent scene, NO collage or grid of images
- NO extra text, NO watermarks, NO additional logos besides {{ logo_text }}
