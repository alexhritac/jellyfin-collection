VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCORPORATE (from top media in this collection):
{{ visual_signatures }}

Create a dramatic cinematic scene that NATURALLY BLENDS these visual elements into ONE coherent environment.

RULES:
1. Describe ONE unified cinematic scene - NOT a collage
2. The TOP visual elements (first 2-3) should be PROMINENT in the foreground
3. Secondary elements can appear as subtle background details
4. Use SILHOUETTES and ANONYMOUS FIGURES - no character names
5. Focus on ATMOSPHERE, LIGHTING, and ENVIRONMENT
6. All elements must be GROUNDED (on floor, held, on surfaces) - NO floating objects
7. Keep it 2-3 sentences max

GOOD example: "A tall silhouette with pointed ears stands in a bioluminescent jungle clearing, cyan light from glowing plants reflecting off their skin, while in the distance emerald green magical sparks swirl around a cloaked figure on a golden brick path, both gazing at a towering crystalline city where orange flames lick the skyline."

Output ONLY the scene description, nothing else.
